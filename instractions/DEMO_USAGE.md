# Size-Based Pricing System - Demo Usage

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

Your size-based pricing system is now fully implemented and working! Here's what you can do:

## üéØ Admin Panel Usage

### 1. Creating Products WITHOUT Sizes (Base Price)
1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Add Product
2. Fill in product details (name, price, MRP, etc.)
3. **UNCHECK** "Do you want to add sizes for this product?"
4. Save product
5. **Result**: Product uses base price automatically

### 2. Creating Products WITH Sizes (Fixed/Percentage Pricing)
1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Add Product
2. Fill in product details
3. **CHECK** "Do you want to add sizes for this product?"
4. Add sizes with different pricing strategies:
   - **Use Base Price**: Size uses product's base price
   - **Fixed Price**: Set specific price for this size
   - **Percentage**: Set percentage of base price (e.g., 110% = 10% more)
5. Save product
6. **Result**: Each size has its own calculated price

## üõçÔ∏è Customer Experience

### Product List Page (Allproducts.jsx)
- Products WITHOUT sizes: Shows regular price
- Products WITH sizes: Shows "Starting from ‚ÇπX" and size badges
- Size availability indicator appears

### Product Details Page (ProductDetails.jsx)
- Size selection buttons appear for products with sizes
- **Price changes dynamically** when customer selects different sizes
- Customer must select size before adding to cart
- Price display updates with GST calculations

## üìä How Pricing Works

### Scenario 1: Base Price Product
```
Product: T-Shirt
Base Price: ‚Çπ500
GST: 18% (exclusive)
enableSizes: false

Final Price = ‚Çπ500 + (‚Çπ500 √ó 18%) = ‚Çπ590
```

### Scenario 2: Size-Based Pricing
```
Product: T-Shirt with Sizes
Base Price: ‚Çπ500
GST: 18% (exclusive)
enableSizes: true

Sizes:
- S: Use Base (‚Çπ500 + GST = ‚Çπ590)
- M: Use Base (‚Çπ500 + GST = ‚Çπ590)  
- L: Fixed ‚Çπ550 (‚Çπ550 + GST = ‚Çπ649)
- XL: 110% of base (‚Çπ550 + GST = ‚Çπ649)
```

## üîÑ Dynamic Price Updates

When customer clicks different sizes:
1. **S selected**: Price shows ‚Çπ590
2. **L selected**: Price changes to ‚Çπ649
3. **XL selected**: Price shows ‚Çπ649

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Storage

Each size is stored separately with:
- `product_id`: Links to main product
- `size_value`: The size name (S, M, L, etc.)
- `price_modifier_type`: 'none', 'fixed', 'percentage'
- `price`: Fixed price (if applicable)
- `price_modifier_value`: Percentage value (if applicable)
